* Example of lsp semantic highlighting not triggering

  Bare bones dummy major mode with accompanying bare bones language
  server protocol.

* Setup
  - First clone this repository and cd to that directory.

    : $ cd <project directory>
    : $ export DUMMYLSPPATH=$(pwd)
    
    The server is built upon [[https://pygls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][pygls]], a Python framework for creating
    LSP's.  I used Python 3.12, but I think any Python3 version should
    work.  Install with the following
    
    : $ python3 -m venv .venv
    : $ .venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    : $ .venv/bin/python -m pip install pygls

  - Make a script to invoke ~pygls~ using this virtual environment
    like so:

    : $DUMMYLSPPATH/.venv/bin/pytyhon dummylsp.py

    Call the script ~dummylsp~ and make sure it's in your PATH.

  - Eval ~dummy-mode.el~ to define the dummy mode.
  - Eval ~emacs.el~ to connect this dummy mode to the lsp.
  - Open up ~mydoc.dummy~
  - ~M-x dummy-mode~
  - ~M-x lsp~
  - Note that the comment is not highlighted.  Move onto the comment and test:
	~M-:~ -> ~(get-text-property (point) 'face)~.
  - Check ~font-lock-fontified~
  - ~M-:~ -> ~(setq font-lock-fontified t)~
  - You might need to make some changes to the document to trigger the
    highlighting request, but it should fontify at this point.
  - Alternative to the last step, try running ~font-lock-ensure~.
